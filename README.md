# Task 1: Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository serves as the submission for **Task 1** of the Cyber Security Internship. The project focuses on establishing a strong theoretical foundation in cybersecurity principles, threat actor profiling, and attack surface mapping.

## 📄 Contents
* **`Task_1_Report.pdf`**: A comprehensive document detailing:
  * The **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) with industry-specific examples.
  * A breakdown of **Threat Actors** (Script Kiddies, Insiders, Hacktivists, Nation-States).
  * **Attack Surface Analysis** covering Web, Mobile, API, and Cloud vectors.
  * A **Data Flow Diagram** analysis identifying vulnerabilities at the User, Network, Server, and Database levels.

## 🛠️ Methodology & Tools
* **Research:** Leveraged **OWASP Top 10** documentation and Google Cybersecurity resources to define vulnerabilities.
* **Analysis:** Mapped the data flow of a standard Banking Application to identify potential injection points and transmission risks.
* **Tools:** * **Browser:** Google Chrome (DevTools for inspecting web requests).
  * **Knowledge Base:** MITRE ATT&CK framework concepts (referenced for threat actor definitions).

## 💡 Key Learnings
1. **The CIA Triad** is the non-negotiable standard for information security; any breach involves a violation of one of these three.
2. **Attack Surfaces** are not just "websites"; they extend to APIs, cloud configurations, and human error (Insiders).
3. **Data Flow Security:** Securing the endpoint is not enough; the entire pipeline (Transit -> Server -> Database) must be secured against specific threats like **SQL Injection** and **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** attacks.
